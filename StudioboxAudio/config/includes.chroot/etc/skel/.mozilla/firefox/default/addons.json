The add-on is supported by over forty filter subscriptions in dozens of languages which automatically configure it for purposes ranging from removing online advertising to blocking all known malware domains. Adblock Plus also allows you to customize your filters with the assistance of a variety of useful features, including a context option for images, a block tab for Flash and Java objects, and a list of blockable items to remove scripts and stylesheets.\n\nStarting with Adblock Plus 2.0 there is an option in Filter Preferences to allow some non-intrusive advertising. The goal is to support websites using non-intrusive ways to advertise and to encourage more websites to do the same.

See who's tracking your web browsing and block them with Ghostery.","fullDescription":"DETECT\nGhostery sees the \"invisible\" web, detecting trackers, web bugs, pixels, and beacons placed on web pages by Facebook, Google, and thousands of other companies interested in your activity.\n\nLEARN\nAfter showing you who operates behind the scenes, Ghostery also gives you the opportunity to learn more about each company it identifies, including links to their privacy policy and opt-out options.\n\nCONTROL\nGhostery allows you to block scripts from companies that you don't trust, delete local shared objects, and even block images and iframes.\n\nCOLLABORATE\nGhostery also includes the optional, opt-in feature called Ghostrank, which sends Ghostery servers anonymous information about the trackers you encounter and where you encounter them. This allows us to create a more comprehensive list of detectable items, and helps us create a more transparent behavioral advertising ecosystem.\n\nPROTECT YOUR PRIVACY\nGhostery is built and maintained for users that care about their online privacy, and is engineered with privacy as a primary goal. Ghostery use is anonymous. No registrations or sign-ups are required. The Ghostery plug-in does not place cookies into your browser. Besides a single, non-identified ping on install and upgrade, Ghostery never receives any data from users unless they've chosen to participate in Ghostrank. Ghostrank data itself is anonymous, is NEVER used for advertising targeting purposes, and is only shared in aggregated, non-personal, statistical form.\n\nFor more information, check out Ghostery's privacy policy and our FAQ.\n\nGhostery's source code is straight-forward - for some hands-on privacy management goodness, look inside! You'll find that Ghostery works just like we describe.\n\nCONNECT\nVisit our support forum: http://getsatisfaction.com/ghostery\nFollow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Ghostery\nFriend us on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/ghostery\nCheck out the blog: http://purplebox.ghostery.com","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134424.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","width":"700","height":"508","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134424.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"145","caption":"Menu shows you all the web bug trackers found on a site and lets you learn more about each bug including being able to view their source code."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134426.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","width":"700","height":"424","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134426.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"121","caption":"New Ghostery panel allows for quick tracker settings, selective site unblocking, and many other new features."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/134/134428.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","width":"700","height":"396","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/134/134428.png?src=api&modified=1428333161","thumbnailWidth":"200","thumbnailHeight":"113","caption":"Get notified when web bugs are found.
